This repository demonstrates how to predict vehicle mileage (miles per gallon) using regression analysis techniques in Python.
The analysis follows these key steps:

1. Data Exploration and Preprocessing:
The dataset is loaded and inspected for missing values and data types.
Relationships between variables are visualized using scatter plots and regression plots.
Missing values are handled, and relevant features are selected for modeling.
Feature scaling is performed to standardize the input data.

2. Linear Regression Modeling:
The dataset is split into training and testing sets.
A linear regression model is trained on the training data to learn the relationship between features and mileage.
The model's performance is evaluated on the testing set using metrics like mean absolute error, mean absolute percentage error, and R-squared score.

3. Polynomial Regression Modeling:
Polynomial features are generated to capture potential non-linear relationships in the data.
A linear regression model is trained on the polynomial features.
The model's performance is evaluated on the testing set using the same metrics as before.
